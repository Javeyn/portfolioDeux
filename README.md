### Description
This is my 2nd iteration of my portfolio. I wanted to step away from the standard look and do something that I felt better represented my style. Clean, simple, and quick, just the way I like it!

### Technology
I am proud of this project because the main feature of the page is a styling I am absolutely in love with: Parralax scrolling. By using that I was able to create a scroll effect that made my one page look like 5 different pages through scrolling. It is also easy enough to implement where I could easily tack another section in without much work at all. Quite cool!



### Thoughts

I would like to thank all of my classmates for helping prop me up when I was down, and celebrating me when I was up. I could just say "all of them", but I wanted to call them out by name. Aidan, Liam, Jenny, Paolo, Isabel, Greg, and Austin; Thanks for being my immediate vicinity support. Chris, Henry, Aslan, Adam, Rafi; Your know-how when I am struggling with a concept is always met with patience and kindess.

I would also like to thank Joe, Denis, and Clint, my Intructor's for the course. Their patience with us as we learn and their knowledge has been instrumental in my success. A big tip of the hat to those gentleman.

I'd also like to thank W3 schools for their plethora of useful, albeit sometimes vague information.
